- A new window will open where you will need to configure Gmail SMTP;
- We strongly recommend to use gmail app password. Don't know how to create app password? Check it [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

## Other SMTP account

- Click on SMTP icon;
- In the provided form youâ€™ll need to fill all fields: a senderâ€™s name and email, both SMTP and IMAP logins, passwords, servers and ports;
- Click on Test SMTP and Test IMAP to check if provided credentials are correct - a notification will inform you if everything is alright;
- Enabling SSL encryption and certificate validation is optional, yet we recommend enabling them to increase the security of transactions;
- Finally, click Save to connect the account.

**Note:** mail accountsâ€™ number is not limited, add and use as many mail accounts as you need.

Once the mail account is added click Edit to set your **senderâ€™s name** and a **signature**.
A recognisable senderâ€™s name and informative signature will complete your email in a proper tone.
