**First step:** type in campaign name and select the mail account from which emails will be sent and click Next to proceed.

**Second step:** you need to provide a list of recipients. It can be done either by uploading a file with the recipients list or typing in the list of recipients - don’t forget to click *Import* afterwards! This step can be skipped and you can go to the other step by clicking Next. But note that you’ll not be able to send out the campaign without recipients added.

**Third step:** set up a message by typing in the subject line and message text. If you want to use your previously created template or use one of our prepared templates - just click on *Templates*.

**Note:** Custom Variables such as recipient name, last name, Company name and unsubscribe link can be added to the message in this step.

Additionally, **follow up emails** can be set in this step. Click on *Add follow-up* to pick a delay and add another email to the flow.
